   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Type-check
npm run typecheck
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Provide explicit return types for functions
- Use type inference where appropriate

### Code Style

- Follow existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and concise

```

## Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

### Contract Tests

Test tool schemas and business logic without network calls:

```typescript
// tests/contract/tool-name.test.ts
describe('tool_name contract', () => {
  it('should validate input parameters', async () => {
    // Test input validation
  });

  it('should handle create action', async () => {
    // Test business logic
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test cross-feature workflows and external interactions:

```typescript
// tests/integration/feature.test.ts
describe('feature integration', () => {
  it('should handle end-to-end workflow', async () => {
    // Test complete workflows
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
