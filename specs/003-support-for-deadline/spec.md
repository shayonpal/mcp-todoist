# Feature Specification: Deadline Support for Tasks

**Feature Branch**: `003-support-for-deadline`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Ready
**Input**: User description: "support for deadline feature (check task ID 6f2QV8vWCvmf5RgR in todoist for details)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Should the system block deadlines on recurring tasks since deadlines don't recur? ‚Üí A: No, allow but warn that it's ineffective since deadlines can't recur
- Q: Should the system block past deadline dates? ‚Üí A: No, allow but append reminder that the deadline is in the past
- Q: Should the system provide format instructions to tool callers? ‚Üí A: Yes, provide clear date format guidance (YYYY-MM-DD) to minimize request rejections

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
AI assistants and developers need to specify completion deadlines for tasks that are distinct from start dates (due dates). Deadlines differentiate between when a task should be started (due date) and when it must be done by (deadline). This provides clearer project planning and tracking capabilities by separating task initiation from completion targets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new task is being created, **When** the user specifies both a due date and a deadline, **Then** the system stores both dates with the task and displays them distinctly
2. **Given** an existing task without a deadline, **When** the user updates the task to add a deadline, **Then** the system saves the deadline without affecting the existing due date
3. **Given** a task with a deadline, **When** the user updates or removes the deadline, **Then** the system persists the change and continues to maintain any existing due date
4. **Given** a user creates a task with only a deadline (no due date), **When** the task is saved, **Then** the system accepts and stores the deadline independently
5. **Given** a recurring task is being updated, **When** the user adds a deadline, **Then** the system saves the deadline but returns a warning that deadlines don't recur and will remain static
6. **Given** a user creates or updates a task, **When** the specified deadline date is in the past, **Then** the system saves the deadline but returns a reminder that the deadline is in the past
7. **Given** a user attempts to create or update a task with an invalid deadline format, **When** the request is submitted, **Then** the system rejects the request with a clear error message explaining the required format (YYYY-MM-DD with examples)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a deadline is set before the due date? System allows any date configuration without validation (deadline can be before, same as, or after due date)
- How does the system handle deadline updates on recurring tasks? System allows deadlines on recurring tasks but returns a warning message that deadlines cannot recur and will remain static, making this often ineffective
- What happens when a deadline date is in the past during task creation? System accepts past deadlines but appends a reminder message that the specified deadline is in the past
- What happens when an invalid date format is provided? System rejects the request with a clear error message specifying the required YYYY-MM-DD format and providing examples (e.g., "2025-10-15")

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to specify a deadline date when creating a new task
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to specify a deadline date when updating an existing task
- **FR-003**: System MUST store deadline dates in YYYY-MM-DD format conforming to RFC 3339
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain deadline dates independently from due dates (both can coexist on the same task)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow tasks to have only a deadline (no due date required)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow tasks to have only a due date (no deadline required)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow tasks to have both a deadline and a due date
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to remove an existing deadline from a task
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate deadline date format (YYYY-MM-DD) and reject invalid formats with clear error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST return the deadline field (with date and lang properties) when retrieving task details
- **FR-010a**: System MUST provide clear format instructions (YYYY-MM-DD with examples) in tool documentation to help callers format dates correctly
- **FR-011**: System MUST accept deadline dates on both recurring and non-recurring tasks (no blocking based on recurrence status)
- **FR-012**: System MUST NOT perform temporal validation on deadline dates (past dates are acceptable)
- **FR-013**: System MUST return a warning message when a deadline is added to a recurring task, noting that deadlines cannot recur and will remain static
- **FR-014**: System MUST return a reminder message when a past deadline date is specified, alerting the user that the deadline is in the past

### Key Entities

- **Task Deadline**: Represents when a task must be done by (distinct from due date which indicates when a task should be started)
  - Contains `date` property in YYYY-MM-DD format (RFC 3339)
  - Contains `lang` property (output only, currently unused in processing)
  - No time component or recurrence support
  - Can be applied to both recurring and non-recurring tasks, but deadline value itself does not recur
  - System warns users when deadline is added to recurring task (ineffective pattern)
  - System reminds users when past deadline date is specified
  - System validates format and provides clear error messages with format examples when invalid
  - Tool documentation includes format instructions and examples to minimize rejections
  - Optional field - tasks can exist without deadlines
  - Independent of due date - both fields can be present or absent
  - Provided as `deadline` attribute when creating or updating tasks
